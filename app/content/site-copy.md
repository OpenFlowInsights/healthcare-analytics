**Timeline:** 6–8 weeks from specification to deployment

- Quarterly measure specification reviews (HEDIS, MSSP, etc.)

## About Page Copy

### Company Overview
Open Flow Insights provides analytics consulting and custom dashboard development for healthcare organizations. We work with MSSP ACOs, Medicare Advantage plans, and health systems that are drowning in data but starving for insight.

We don't sell a platform. We don't have a "one size fits all" solution. We build the analytics infrastructure your organization actually needs—whether that's a shared savings forecasting tool, a risk adjustment gap dashboard, or a full data warehouse architecture.

Our clients range from 5,000-member ACOs to 100,000+ member MA plans. What they have in common: they tried to build this in-house, realized it's harder than it looks, and called us.

### Our Approach
**We start with the question, not the tool.** Most vendors want to sell you their platform and make you adapt your workflow to fit it. We start by asking: What decisions are you trying to make? What data do you have? What does your team actually need to see?

From there, we build custom dashboards, data pipelines, and analytics infrastructure tailored to your organization. We use modern, flexible technology (Snowflake for data warehousing, Next.js for dashboards, dbt for transformations) so you're not locked into proprietary systems.

**We train your team, then hand it off.** Our goal isn't to keep you dependent on us. We build tools your team can maintain, we document everything, and we train your staff to run it. Some clients stay on for ongoing support. Others take full ownership after 6 months. Both are wins.

### Who We Serve
- **MSSP ACOs:** Shared savings forecasting, attribution tracking, benchmark analysis
- **Medicare Advantage Plans:** Risk adjustment, Star Ratings, quality gap closure
- **Health Systems:** Population health analytics, network utilization, cost management
- **Value-Based Care Organizations:** Any group taking financial risk and needing data to manage it
