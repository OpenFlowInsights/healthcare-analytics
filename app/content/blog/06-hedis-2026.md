HEDIS 2026 dropped in September 2025, and if your plan is still running 2025 measure logic, you're already behind. NCQA made substantive changes this year—not just technical clarifications, but **measure retirements, new measures, and structural shifts in how electronic clinical data (ECD) gets validated**.

The plans that wait until Q4 2026 to figure this out will spend December in a panic trying to close gaps on measures they didn't know changed. The plans that start now will have clean measure specifications, updated dashboards, and an 11-month head start on performance.

Here's what changed, what it means for your quality scores, and what to do before measurement year 2026 starts (if it hasn't already).

## What's New: Measure Changes at a Glance

### Retired Measures (Say Goodbye)

**1. Medical Assistance with Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation (MSC)**
- **Why retired:** Low uptake, overlapping with other preventive measures
- **Impact:** If this was a high-performing measure for your plan, you lose those easy points. If it was low-performing, good—stop tracking it.

**2. Medication Management for People with Asthma (MMA)**
- **Why retired:** Replaced by more comprehensive respiratory care measures
- **Impact:** Moderate. This measure had narrow denominators anyway.

**3. Follow-Up After Emergency Department Visit for People with Multiple High-Risk Chronic Conditions (FMC)**
- **Why retired:** NCQA determined it overlapped too heavily with existing follow-up measures (FUH, FUM)
- **Impact:** Minimal for most plans. This was hard to score well on and had low star weight.

### New Measures (Start Tracking Now)

**1. Screening for Social Drivers of Health (SSD)**
- **What it measures:** Percentage of members who were screened for food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility help, and interpersonal safety
- **Why it matters:** This is the first HEDIS measure tied to **social determinants of health (SDoH)**. NCQA is moving toward value-based care that addresses root causes, not just medical treatment.
- **Data source:** EHR (structured data fields) or health risk assessments (HRA)
- **Denominator:** All members 18+ with at least one office visit during measurement year
- **Big challenge:** Most EHRs don't have standardized SDoH screening fields. You'll need to work with providers to implement structured data capture.

**2. Prenatal Immunization Status (PRS)**
- **What it measures:** Pregnant members who received Tdap and flu vaccines during pregnancy
- **Why it matters:** Aligns with CDC maternal health guidelines and addresses preventable complications
- **Data source:** Immunization registry, EHR, or claims (with procedure codes)
- **Denominator:** All members with live births during measurement year
- **Big challenge:** Immunization data is notoriously incomplete. You'll need registry feeds or strong EHR integration.

**3. Follow-Up After High-Intensity Care for Substance Use Disorder (FUI)**
- **What it measures:** Members with SUD diagnosis who had a follow-up visit within 7 or 30 days after ED visit or inpatient discharge related to substance use
- **Why it matters:** Addresses opioid crisis and behavioral health integration gaps
- **Data source:** Claims or EHR
- **Denominator:** Members with SUD-related acute care event
- **Big challenge:** Linking inpatient/ED events to outpatient follow-up requires tight claims-to-encounter integration

**4. Postpartum Depression Screening and Follow-Up (PDS)**
- **What it measures:** Postpartum members who were screened for depression and, if positive, had appropriate follow-up
- **Why it matters:** Maternal mental health is a national priority. Plans with maternity programs will be heavily scrutinized on this.
- **Data source:** EHR (screening tools like Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) or claims
- **Denominator:** All members with live births during prior measurement year who had postpartum visit
- **Big challenge:** Two-part measure (screening + follow-up) means you can't just check a box—you need closed-loop workflows

## What Changed: Measure Specification Updates

Even measures that *weren't* retired got tweaked. Here are the updates that will trip up plans who don't read the fine print:

### Colorectal Cancer Screening (COL)
- **Change:** Stool-based test frequency updated to reflect new USPSTF guidance
- **Impact:** FIT-DNA tests (Cologuard) now qualify for 3-year lookback instead of 1-year
- **Action:** Update your gap lists to avoid over-outreaching to members who are actually compliant

### Controlling High Blood Pressure (CBP)
- **Change:** Blood pressure threshold remains <140/90, but **telehealth readings now count** (with documentation requirements)
- **Impact:** Should improve performance if your plan scaled telehealth during COVID and maintained it
- **Action:** Ensure telehealth vendors are documenting BP readings in structured EHR fields (not just visit notes)

### Diabetes Care Measures (HBD, KED)
- **Change:** Lab result value sets expanded to include more LOINC codes
- **Impact:** You might be missing compliant results because your data mapping is incomplete
- **Action:** Re-validate your EHR/lab feed mappings against the new LOINC value sets

### Breast Cancer Screening (BCS)
- **Change:** Digital breast tomosynthesis (3D mammography) now explicitly listed in value sets
- **Impact:** Should be neutral, but verify your claims coding logic recognizes the CPT codes
- **Action:** Audit a sample of 3D mammogram claims to ensure they're being counted

## The Big Structural Change: Electronic Clinical Data (ECD) Validation

NCQA has been pushing plans toward **ECD submission** (pulling data directly from EHRs) instead of relying purely on claims and chart review. HEDIS 2026 raises the bar on ECD validation requirements.

### What's New in ECD for 2026

**1. Stricter Data Quality Audits**
- NCQA will sample ECD submissions and request **source documentation** from provider EHRs
- If your ECD data doesn't match the source, your entire ECD submission can be invalidated
- **Impact:** You can't just accept whatever your EHR vendor sends. You need to audit it.

**2. Expanded ECD-Eligible Measures**
- Several measures that were previously claims-only can now be supplemented with ECD
- **Advantage:** If your claims are incomplete (e.g., member got a mammogram at a non-contracted facility), ECD can fill the gap
- **Disadvantage:** You now need to manage two data sources and reconcile conflicts

**3. Required Data Element Completeness**
- For core measures (CBP, HBD, BCS, etc.), NCQA now expects **≥80% completeness** on key data elements (e.g., if you're submitting BP values, 80% of eligible encounters must have BP recorded)
- **Impact:** If your providers have spotty EHR documentation, your ECD data will fail validation

### How to Prepare Your ECD Infrastructure

**Phase 1: Validate Your EHR Feeds (By March 2026)**
- Pull 6 months of ECD (lab results, vitals, screenings) from your EHR integration
- Compare to claims data for the same patients
- Flag discrepancies: Did the EHR show an HbA1c result that's not in claims? Did claims show a mammogram that's not in the EHR?
- Quantify **data completeness rates** by provider group and measure

**Phase 2: Provider Education (April–June 2026)**
- Share completeness reports with provider groups
- Highlight measures where ECD can boost their scores (e.g., "Your claims show 68% BP control, but EHR data could push you to 75%")
- Train on **structured data entry**: BP readings need to be in vitals flowsheet, not buried in visit notes
- Incentivize: Tie ECD completeness to quality incentive payments

**Phase 3: Hybrid Submission Strategy (July–December 2026)**
- For measures with strong ECD coverage (>80% completeness), use ECD as primary source
- For measures with weak ECD coverage, stick with claims + chart review
- **Don't submit bad ECD data just to check a box**—it can hurt more than it helps if NCQA invalidates it

## The Q4 Scramble: What You Can Still Do If You're Late

Let's say it's October 2026 and you're just realizing you're behind on the new measures. Here's the triage:

**Focus Area 1: New Measures with Existing Data**
- **PRS (prenatal immunizations):** Pull immunization records from registries NOW. Don't wait for claims.
- **FUI (SUD follow-up):** Query your claims for SUD-related ED/inpatient events from Jan–Sept, generate outreach lists for members who haven't had follow-up.

**Focus Area 2: Retired Measures (Stop Wasting Time)**
- **MSC, MMA, FMC:** Remove these from your dashboards and outreach campaigns. Redirect that effort to measures that still count.

**Focus Area 3: High-Value Measure Updates**
- **COL (colorectal screening):** Re-run your gap list with updated 3-year lookback for FIT-DNA tests. You'll find members who are compliant but were flagged as overdue.
- **CBP (blood pressure):** Chase down telehealth BP readings that your claims system might have missed.

**Focus Area 4: Provider Engagement**
- **SSD (social drivers):** This is the hardest new measure. If you haven't implemented SDoH screening tools yet, you won't hit meaningful performance in Year 1. Start piloting with 2-3 provider groups for 2027.

## The 2026 HEDIS Checklist

Before measurement year ends (December 31, 2026), make sure you can answer "yes" to these:

- [ ] Removed retired measures (MSC, MMA, FMC) from all dashboards and reports
- [ ] Built specifications for new measures (SSD, PRS, FUI, PDS) in your data warehouse
- [ ] Updated measure logic for changed specifications (COL, CBP, diabetes measures)
- [ ] Validated ECD feeds from all major EHR systems
- [ ] Trained providers on structured data entry for ECD-eligible measures
- [ ] Generated gap lists for new measures and assigned to outreach teams
- [ ] Audited a sample of ECD submissions against source documentation
- [ ] Documented data quality issues and remediation plans for NCQA audit

If you can't check all these boxes, you're at risk of:
- Missing points on new measures (because you didn't track them)
- Wasting effort on retired measures (because you didn't turn them off)
- Losing ECD submissions to validation failures (because you didn't audit)

## The Long Game: What's Coming After 2026

NCQA isn't done. Here's what to expect in the next 2-3 years:

- **More SDoH measures**: Screening is just the start. Expect measures around SDoH *intervention* (did you help the member access food/housing resources?)
- **Health equity stratification**: NCQA will start publishing performance by race, ethnicity, and language—and plans will be expected to close disparity gaps
- **Behavioral health integration**: More measures linking physical and mental health care (depression screening in primary care, collaborative care models)
- **Total cost of care measures**: HEDIS has been utilization- and process-focused. Expect outcome and cost measures to creep in.

Plans that build **flexible analytics infrastructure** now—data warehouses that can ingest new measure specs, dashboards that can pivot to new populations, ECD pipelines that can scale—will adapt faster than plans still running Excel-based HEDIS engines.

## The Bottom Line

HEDIS 2026 isn't a revolution, but it's not trivial either. Three measures out, four measures in, and a structural shift toward electronic clinical data that rewards plans with strong EHR integration and provider engagement.

If you're reading this in Q1 2026, you're ahead of the curve. Get your measure specs updated, your dashboards rebuilt, and your ECD audited before measurement year starts.

If you're reading this in Q4 2026, you're late—but not too late. Triage the high-value changes, stop wasting time on retired measures, and start planning for 2027 now.
